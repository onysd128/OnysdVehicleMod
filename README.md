MrCrayfish's Vehicle Mod is about creating fun and useful vehicles. In this mod you can find an assortment of vehicles that will help you explore, farm, transport, race, and even fly! Every vehicle can be customised with different engines and wheels to change the speed and effective surfaces the vehicles can drive on.
